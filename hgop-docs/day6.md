# Day 6

Goal of the day is to get the server into a state to accept create game commands. Use
integration code recently pushed to stefaneg/hgop2015 as a reference. You can
copy-paste all new logic introduced in this push. You will also have to refactor 
commands/events to work with gameIds. 

Note that you should NOT replace your implementation of tictactoe. You must take
your implementation and put in place of mine (tictactoeCommandHandler.js).

You are done when you can post a create game command and get events with id back.

Hints:
- You'll have to install 'q' to use the memory store.
- Change gameHistory.spec.js to mata
- Adapt router.js and change the verbs there to match those in your commands.
