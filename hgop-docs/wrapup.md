### Project wrap up and turning in.

- Copy all shell scripts from Jenkins and put in your report.md, with the name of the build step
as a header.

- You will also have to turn in the assignment in MySchool. Create a .txt file which contains the URL
of your GitHub repository (with .git ending), and nothing else. Like this:

``` 
https://github.com/stefaneg/hgop2015.git
```
