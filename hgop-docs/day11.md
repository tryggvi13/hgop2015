### Day 11 - integrate client and client smoke test

Final part of course project.  Integrate client logic, and get to a playable game.  
Pull changes from stefaneg/hgop2015 in order to get a "working" client. 
Adapt client to match your server to the extent possible.

The plan was to include a smoke test for the client as well in the project. However, the
project is not in a state to support this with reasonable work so we'll have to skip this
part..

When you can play the game to draw or finish using the simple web client, you're done.
